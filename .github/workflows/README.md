# Actions to build and push actors and providers to OCI registry - dev and semVer

The workflows are works in process, documentation may not be up to date, and they may not be perfect as I may consolidate into fewer workflows. They are also pulled from private repositories and as such may not be up to date with latest working.
I am currently using these workflows, but have not tested them in this repo.

These workflows adhere to a specific directory and naming structure which can be seen in other readme's.
